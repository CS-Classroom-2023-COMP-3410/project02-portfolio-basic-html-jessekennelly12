# Reflection

I built my portfolio site using only HTML and to be honest had trouble settling on a theme. I went with nothing in particular, but I feel like what I created is very much me, without having a distinct theme. I guess cats are maybe a theme. 

I started by planning a directory structure (home/about/contact plus projects and gallery folders) so the site would be logically organized.

The biggest challenge was creating visual variety without CSS. To solve that, I used style HTML attributes like `bgcolor`, `text`, `link`, and `vlink`, along with other structure settings like headings, sections, lists, figures, and tables, to keep the pages readable and distinct. 

Another challenge was satisfying the 10 images requirement while keeping file sizes reasonable, so I used a mix of my own screenshots/photos and a few small theme images, and kept them organized in an `gallery/` folder.
